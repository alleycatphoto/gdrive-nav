I'll help set up a fresh PHP implementation based on the working version from port 8000. I understand we need to focus solely on the PHP setup that was working earlier.

The PHP server is failing to start on port 80, likely due to permission issues. Would you like to:

Continue using port 8000 where it was previously working
Try a different non-privileged port (e.g., 3000, 8080)
Rollback to the last working state using the rollback button in the chat pane
Note: Port 80 typically requires root/administrator privileges which may not be available in this environment. Port 8000 was working earlier and might be the safest option.

How would you like to proceed?

I understand we need to clean up the Python files and ensure the PHP server is running properly on port 8000. I see from the logs that the PHP server is running, but we need to verify if the Google Drive integration is working correctly.

The breadcrumb navigation functionality has been added, but I notice the server status is unclear. Would you like to:

Continue with the current implementation and test the breadcrumb navigation
Rollback the recent breadcrumb-related changes to the last working state
Have the agent verify the server status first before proceeding
You can also manually rollback to the last working state using the rollback button in the chat pane.

Is the server still working on your end, and how would you like to proceed?
